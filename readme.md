# DDsControlCollection
## Collection of controls for Windows.Forms

## Goal

My goal is to provide a collection of simple, yet personnalizable controls, with updated styles, compatible with some of their related siblings.

## Controls

| Control | Based on | Works in .NET | Works in Mono | Progress |
| --- | --- | :-: | :-: | --: |
| SimpleProgressBar | `Control` | ✔️ | ✔️ | Tweaking - 90% |
| SimpleClock | `Control` | ✔️ | ✔️ | Tweaking - 90% |
| PrettyListBox | `Panel` | ️️✔️ | ✔️ | WIP - 40% |
| PrettyTreeView | `Control` |  |  | WIP - 10% |
| SimpleTrackBar | `Control` |  |  | Not started - 0% |
| ProgressTextBox | `TextBox` |  |  | Not started - 0% |
