## Collection of controls for Windows.Forms

A bunch of WinForm controls that I'll be doing here and then.

I started this because I wanted a bit more from `ProgressBar`, and I disliked how `ProgressBar` behaved (in Windows).

Also I plan to use those in my future projects.

Mostly still in development!

Feel free to post any issues or suggestions.
